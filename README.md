# TextGame
This is where my TextGame is being stored and updated.

This is a playable game that is based entirely in the console (for now - eventually
I would like to make it an Android GUI playable and downloadable from the 
Google Play Store). 
This game will start with an adventurer who lives in the middle of the woods,
alone. They can begin to explore their world, but they must be careful,
as their surroundings are full of danger.
